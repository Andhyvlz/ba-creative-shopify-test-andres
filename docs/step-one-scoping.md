# Step One: Scoping (Project Scope Document)

## 1. Purpose of the Document
The purpose of this document is to define the complete scope of the Shopify Theme Development Test Project. It establishes what will be built, what is out of scope, the expected deliverables, dependencies, risks, and the criteria that determine when the work is considered complete. This document acts as a technical and functional agreement for the project.

## 2. Project Overview
This project consists of implementing a custom Shopify theme based on a provided Figma design. The goal is to accurately reproduce the visual layout, maintain brand consistency, ensure smooth navigation on both desktop and mobile, and allow all relevant content to be editable through the Shopify Theme Editor.

The work is considered complete when:
- The implemented design matches the Figma layout and styling.
- All key sections are editable through the Theme Editor.
- The site is usable and readable on desktop and mobile.
- No major visual or functional issues remain.
- Code is fully synchronized with GitHub.
- The final result is reviewed and approved.
